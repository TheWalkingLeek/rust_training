# Rust Training

Repo for rust exercises and such as I'm trying to learn the language.

To run the projects there should always be an executable under something like {name}/target/debug/{name}
(e.g `havel_hakimi/target/debug/havel_hakimi`)

you can obviously also build and run it yourself using cargo (`cargo run`).
